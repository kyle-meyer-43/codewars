// Let's play rock paper scissors!

// Parameters: show the winner of the game. If a draw, return "draw!"

// Return: looks like just need to return? Might be good to do console.log

// examples: 
    // rps('scissors','paper') // Player 1 won!
    // rps('scissors','rock') // Player 2 won!
    // rps('paper','paper') // Draw!

// Pseudo code: conditional statments? would work to display which "card" (play) won, but not which player made the play
